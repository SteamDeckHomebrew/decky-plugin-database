The app adds a brightness slider inside the decky plugin.

Steps to run from github:
1. Open Desktop Mode
2. Install Node.js 18 or newer
4. Extract the zip and place it inside Home/homebrew/plugins directory (if you are not allowed to place the folder in there right click on the plugins folder and click on properties, select Permissions and set all permissions to "Can View & Modify Content", save and close the folder and reopen it again. This should allow you to paste in that directory.)
5. Right click on the pwmless-brightness-control-main folder and select "Open Terminal Here"
6. Make sure you have pnpm installed as well by running "pnpm -v"
7. If you dont have pnpm run "npm install -g pnpm" to install it.
8. Run "pnpm i"
9. Run "pnpm run build"
10. Once this is done you can go back to gaming mode and give it a try.
